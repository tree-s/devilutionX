# Nintendo Switch Port of DevilutionX (Diablo)

# How To Install:
 - Put `devilutionx.nro` and `CharisSILB.ttf` in into `/switch/devilutionx`
 - Copy diabdat.mpq from your CD (or GoG install folder) to `/switch/devilutionx`. Make sure it is all lowercase.
 - Launch `devilutionx.nro`. (Do not use album to launch; see the note below.)
 - *Note:* Hold R on any installed game and launch it. Do not use album to launch. If you use album, the homebrew will only have a small amount memory available, and the touch keyboard won't work. This is true for all homebrew, not just DevilutionX.
